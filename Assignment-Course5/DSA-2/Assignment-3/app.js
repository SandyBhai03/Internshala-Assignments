//Q-2. You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2. Merge the two lists into
//one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two
//lists. Return the head of the merged linked list. Leetcode 21 (10 marks)

// Q-4 Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it. There is
// a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by
// continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the
// node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
// Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false. Leetcode 141 (10 marks)

// Solution Link- https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/submissions/1519788852/
// Description- 
//Time Complexity- O(n + k) n is the numbers of nodes and k is the cycle length 
// Space Complexity- O(1)
